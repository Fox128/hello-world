My first repository

Hello Class,

This is Wei Jiang. I studied economics and mathematics as an undergrad but finally found myself being more interested in people and behavioral science. Thus, I decided to get my master degree in organizational psychology. I am currently working for a management consulting firm in DC. Have a good semester.

Best,
Wei
